# Stock Price Prediction with TensorFlow

This project uses historical stock data (from Yahoo Finance) to build and train machine learning models for price prediction.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn yfinance scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## How to Run

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Untitled8.ipynb
```

2. Run all cells in order.

3. The notebook will:
   - Download historical data for `RELIANCE.NS` (ensure you have internet access).
   - Save data as CSV.
   - Perform data analysis and modeling using TensorFlow.

## Notes

- If Yahoo Finance blocks requests due to rate limits, wait a while and rerun.
- Make sure all required Python packages are installed in your environment.
